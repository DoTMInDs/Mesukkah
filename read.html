                <h3 class="history">The History Behind Mesukkah</h3>
                <p class="start">Sometime after my birth at Nsaba-Agona in the central Region, my mother and
                     her in-laws at Liati Agbonyra in the volta region. After her stay with them for sometime,
                    she left me under the care of my grandparents at the age of two. My grandmother was a fetish 
                     priestess, a seamstress and a trader by profession while my grandfather was a farmer. 
                     During my childhood days with my grandparents I served them inevery capacity as expected 
                     of a grand-daughter that my grandma put me in charge of the morning duties at the shrine.
                     </p> 
                     <br>
                     <p class="start"> I cleaned up the shrine for the day sacrifices.One of the
                       stringent regulations for the shrine was that, on menstruation, none of us was to stay
                        near the shrine or even in the house. A special place was prepared for such periods
                         for all females (my grandma had plenty of female apprentices) for fear of offending
                          the fetish thus invoking bad spells on them. I, on the contrary, went against these
                           regulations, each time that I was in my period; I remained in the house and eventually
                            went to perform the morning duties at the shrine.</p>
<br>
                            <p class="start">    At this, my grandma always got
                            infuriated and scolded me for displeasing the fetish which may cause evil spells 
                            to cast on me. On one occasion, I asked my grandma, why is it that up till now,
                             the fetish has not done anything to show its displeasure. There has never been an answer.
                            I used to take coins form the offering bowl of the fetish without prior knowledge 
                    of me grandma and whenever she found out, she got annoyed with me for such prohibitive acts. 
                    During the ceremonial rituals, I sung and danced to the melodies of the drummers and on Sundays 
                    I attended the Roman Catholic Church (then the only church in Liati) as a strong C.Y.O member singer and dancer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="start">
                        At the about age 14, my aunt Victoria Nutsh  Atikpladza brought me to Accra to live with her. 
                        I stayed with this aunt until when I got married to Mr. Justin Cofiie. While I was in Accra, 
                        my grandma always invited me home on the celebration of the yearly festival for the shrine
                         because they expected me to succeed my grandma as the next fetish priestess.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="start">
                        Very often at night (in Accra), I experienced weird beings struggling with me to move me out with them.
                         I used to have strange dreams couple with sickness. At one time, I became temporarily dumb for days
                          and was sent home. Incantations and prayers were said until I came back to normal Sickness still followed
                           as well until my mother also agreed that if  it were so , I should allow for the rituals to be performed 
                           for the priesthood to the shrine, so u could live in peace if that was the only solution.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="start">
                        At this point, several high â€“ranking priests and priestesses were invited to a rituals at home to ascertain
                         whether I was pre-ordained by the gods as a successor to my grandma or not. A ceremony was performed where
                         it was said that if a calabash full of water with some charcoal which the senior priestess wa holding was
                          thrown into the air and fell to the ground but remained standing upright without the water spilling out 
                          of it., that would be affirmative but if not then I would not be freed.
